                <h2>Terminal Chess</h2>
                <p>Leader of a team of 2 working on creating a customizable port of Chess that is standardized in the Windows Console. The game is not yet finished, but will 
                    feature a customization menu that will allow users to change the movement style of pieces, and even add their own pieces. We also plan on implementing LAN 
                    multiplayer to allow users to play with friends.
                </p>
                <h3>Experience gained</h3>
                <p><strong>1. Creating flexible algorithms:</strong> All algorithms that have been and will be created need to be made with the impression that users will be
                    able to fundamentally change how the pieces work, meaning that we will need to make them work in a variety of situations. <br/>
                    <strong>2. Utilizing effective data structures:</strong> Since our board size is customizable, effective storage of player information and piece data needs
                    to be used to ensure that load times do not get extended. Board size is available up to 26x26 meaning that large boards can have nearly 700
                    tiles for an inefficient search method to cover, which makes efficient storage a necessity.

                <h2>Terminal Monopoly</h2>
                <p>Member of a team at UF Open Source Club developing Terminal Monopoly, a rendition of the Monopoly board game inside of the computer terminal,
                    featuring LAN multiplayer, minigames, a functional stock market module, and player bargaining. Most recently, I contributed to the efficacy of
                    the community chest and chance cards algorithm, making more unique cards available for players to draw.
                </p>
                <h3>Experience gained</h3>
                <p><strong>1. Working in a medium-sized team:</strong> Working in a team of 10+ members is much more challenging than working on a group project with 3 others.
                    Implementing new ideas is more complex as more people need to be convinced, and it's difficult to not slow down production as a consequence. I
                    hope this provides me with insight and experience in real-world industry workflow. <br/>
                    <strong>2. Contributing to Open Source through Git:</strong> The group does not always meet in person, meaning that working on the project alone necessitates
                    individual work and using data on the GitHub page to make my own decisions on production. It is also important for the entire project
                    to effectively understand Git and GitHub to be able to make contributions through the public repository.

                <h2>Minesweeper</h2>
                <p>My final project for Programming Fundamentals 2, where I developed a clone of Minesweeper in C++ using the SFML library. This featured an updating
                    local leaderboard, customizable board size, a customizable mine count, a functional timer that stopped while the game was paused, and negligible load
                    times that made the game an effective addition to the Windows Minesweeper program.
                </p>
                <h3>Experience gained</h3>
                <p><strong>1. Creating efficient algorithms:</strong> Without the use of efficient algorithms, the game would have buffered at many points during user input. This was a
                    problem that I initially faced while creating the game, and fixed it by optimizing the way that the mine search algorithm and board generation were
                    performed. <br/>
                    <strong>2. Using external libraries and reading documentation:</strong> SFML is not a default library of C++ but features extensive online documentation. This 
                    allowed me to gain experience in reading documentation and discovering how to program in a very unfamiliar scenario. I did not receive assistance
                    in the use of SFML in my class, and managed to effectively program and create a final product despite this. <br/>
                    <strong>3. Using external files to store data:</strong> The leaderboard functionality built into the game was accomplished using the C++ fstream library to read and
                    write information to a leaderboard file stored with the game code. This is also how customizable board sizes and mine count were achieved, through a
                    config file that I also included with the game files.

                <h2>Sudoku</h2>
                <p>Final project for Programming Fundamentals 1, in which I worked with a group of 4 people to develop a clone of Sudoku using Pygame. Featured custom graphics such as
                    small display text before finalizing numerical input into a tile during gameplay, or falling number graphics on user mouse click on the title screen. We also imported
                    custom fonts and sound functionality.
                </p>
                <h3>Experience gained</h3>
                <p><strong>1. Working in a small team:</strong> In a group of 4, I developed skills in team communication and optimized my workflow to contribute to the project despite
                    occasional difficulties in group cohesion. I think this provides valuable experience for future workspaces<br/>
                    <strong>2. Using external libraries and reading documentation:</strong> As we used Pygame to finish this project, we were required to read and understand documentation
                    for this new library we had never seen before. This was a great experience in using a language I was very familiar with for an unfamiliar purpose, which made the project
                    much harder but also much more rewarding. <br/>
